This repository is my solution for the challenge described in [Seja um Guia Front](https://github.com/GuiaBolso/seja-um-guia-front). 
This challenge is part of recruitment process from GuiaBolso to hire front end developers.

This application consumes an API called [ChuckNorris.io](https://api.chucknorris.io/):
- First, it gets a list of categories of jokes.
- Then, user can choose a category and then the application calls ChuckNorris.io to get a joke.

I developed the application using React and Redux. In reducers, I stored the joke categories, the current category and the current joke.
